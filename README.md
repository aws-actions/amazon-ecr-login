## Amazon ECR "Login" Action for GitHub Actions

Logs in the local Docker client to one or more Amazon ECR registries.

## Usage

```yaml
    - name: Login to Amazon ECR
      id: login-ecr
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

    - name: Build, tag, and push image to Amazon ECR
      env:
        ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
        ECR_REPOSITORY: my-ecr-repo
        IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}
      run: |
        docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
        docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
        
    - name: Logout of Amazon ECR
      if: always()
      run: docker logout ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
```

## Credentials and Region

This action relies on the [default behavior of the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) to determine AWS credentials and region.  Use [the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials) to configure the GitHub Actions environment with environment variables containing AWS credentials and your desired region.

We recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) for the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:
* Do not store credentials in your repository's code.  You may use [GitHub Actions secrets](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) to store credentials and redact credentials from GitHub Actions workflow logs.
* [Create an individual IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users) with an access key for use in GitHub Actions workflows, preferably one per repository. Do not use the AWS account root user access key.
* [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.  Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows.  See the Permissions section below for the permissions required by this action.
* [Rotate the credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials) used in GitHub Actions workflows regularly.
* [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.
